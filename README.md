## 0. Understanding the contract

I have seen in the Discord group that there is a common problem for Bull buyers:</br>
`How do I know whether a certian bull has claimed his bear?`.</br>
Most of the responds were you can do it manually by:</br>
- `Step 1:` browsing into the Bull's Opensea page</br>
- `Step 2:` Navigate to the owner's page</br>
- `Step 3:` Copy owner's wallet</br>
- `Step 4:` Open EtherScan website, search for the `Claim bear`</br>
</br>
The problem with this approach is that it takes time and the bull might have been transfered post claim,</br>
in that case you would have to look into every one that has held that bull in the past, again, Manually which brings your back to Step 2.</br>


Therefore, I took the challenge to make an Automation script for that process (Little did I know that it would be much easier than I thought).</br>

### My process began with manual process Following Bull number [#7777](https://opensea.io/assets/0x469823c7b84264d1bafbcd6010e9cdf1cac305a3/7777)</br>

Followed his wallet contracts and lucky me, he claimed his bear!

From there I've found the CryptoClaim Contract written in Solidity (The programming language)
Now we can access the contract and see what kind of functions we have there

<img src="https://github.com/edenbd50/CryptoBull-Claim-Check/blob/main/images/etherscan_contract_functions.png" alt="etherscan_contract_functions" > 

I've highlighted the relevent parts:

- The `Wallet Address` in the URL

- The `Contract` Tab which will show us the Contract code.

- The `Read Contract`  tab which shows the public functions.


And we found our function !!

`4. hasBullClaimed`, I've entered the bull's Id `7777` and hoped for the best, I got in response: `1` which I could guessed that it is claimed, then I tried with my own bull that did not claimed and it returned `0` so it safe to say that whats the function does.

Just to be sure I've jumped into the `Code` tab, searched for the function's name inside the `CryptoBearsClaim.sol` (needed to expand the code in the icon on the right)

<img src="https://github.com/edenbd50/CryptoBull-Claim-Check/blob/main/images/has_bull_claimed_solidity.png" alt="has_bull_claimed" > 

And there it is, thanks for the great developers that actually documanted the code we can understand that:

`0 = False, not claimed`

`1 = True, claimed`



From here I've just scraped the web request from the Contract:

- Entered DevTools -> Network -> Cleared any other requests.

- Pressed the `Query` buttton

- New network request to the SmartContract block has dispatched

- Looking into the Response to verify that it is my response.

- Copy the request as cUrl

]}"
```


By looking at the request I've seen that the 7777 isnt located in any part of the request.. and finally realized that it is part of the data:

`0x45083abc0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001e61`

Only its in `Hex` not in `Dec` 

<img src="https://github.com/edenbd50/CryptoBull-Claim-Check/blob/main/images/dec_to_hex.png" alt="dec_to_hex" > 
 

Since we need to convert each time the Dec number of the Bull that we want to check if he claimed a bear, I've made an Python web app example for everyone to use. :)

  
  

## 2. Configuration
- Download [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-380/) version `3.8.0`

## 3. Requirements
- install requirements.txt
	- `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

## 4. Setup project
- Change the local ip inside app.py
	```python		
	if __name__ == "__main__":
		#app.run() <- Use this in production
		app.run(host="10.0.0.17") # Your local IP
	```
- simply run `app.py`
	- It wil display your local ip and port`
	<img src="https://github.com/edenbd50/CryptoBull-Claim-Check/blob/main/images/ip_port.png" alt="ip_port" height="100" >
 
	
- Navigate to `local_ip:port/7777`
	- Place after the slash the crypto bull that you want to use.
